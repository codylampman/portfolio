                <p>I’ve been designing websites at scale for 6 years, with a focus on post-launch optimization. In short, I make design decisions grounded in observing what users actually say & do.</p>

                <h2>Designing a SaaS website that anyone can update</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="summary">
                <p>Our goal was to build a website that not only showed the best side of MailerLite, but that allowed members from every internal team to easily update pages without a developer’s help. Here's a look at how I iterated and expanded on one feature.</p>
                <div class="role-and-produced">
                    <h5 class="blue">Role: UX design and development</h5>
                    <h5 class="blue">produced at: in house design team</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <img src="/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">

        <p>I came into MailerLite to revamp a 4-year-old website that was built without design oversight. While there were quite a few usability issues to address, our team decided to rebuild the experience on the latest version of Statamic, allowing us to create a new product and rethink every interaction.</p>
        <img src="/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Using Statamic gave use the flexibility to create custom components that our team could use to quickly build their own pages with a visual builder. Although still at the start of my development journey, I was able to design, iterate on, and eventually develop one of our key new Community features, the Wall of Love.</p>
        <img src="/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Through testing the Wall of Love with our non-design team members, we found that it was confusing and painstaking for them to update. They felt guilty having to frequently ask developers for help with the updates. This was especially problematic as their updates were often sporadic and required multiple sprints.</p>
        <img src="/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
        <p>After interviewing a few of our team members who would work with the Wall of Love regularly, I found that they were comfortable working with the Collections within our CMS. This led me to create the Wall of Love as a Collection that the final design then parsed in, rather than using the visual builder. <br><br>Discovering this seemingly counter-intuitive option was one of the biggest challenges, and subsequent breakthroughs, of this project. </p>
        <img src="/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The final product is easy to update and manage for our community team members, and maintained our clean, simple-solution-first design ethos. To this date, the page is regularly updated be members of other teams without issue.</p>

            <p>“Our customers love the design - it makes them feel special seeing those big images of themselves! <span class="red"> 
            What is more amazing to me is how easy it is for us to manage. It shows how much time you put into thinking about our experience with the page and not just how it looks.</span> Thank you!”</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h2>Common questions</h2>
        <div class="question">
            <h4>What makes you different?</h4>
            <p>My non-traditional path to UX is what sets my approach apart. I worked in hospitality, roasted coffee for a designer-founded coffee shop, shot editorial photography, worked for a non-profit on the Navajo reservation, and even skated professionally. It was through skating that I became involved working with various brands to help build their reputations through the design and copywriting on their websites. This naturally led to an (obsessive) interest in user experience design. Around the time that I began to study UX, I also became a practicing student of Zen Buddhism.</p> <p>Suprisingly, many of the key elements of UX design - empathy, critical thinking, and challenging biases - are inherent in Zen buddhist practice. Suffice to say, UX is something that has become a part of my life that is much bigger than just pixels on a display. It influences almost every aspect of my day-to-day life.
                
                <p>At first, this winding path to design resulted in a lot of imposter syndrome, but I have come to see the value that having a diverse set of skills brings. Most recently I have developed a passion for sustainable web design, and have been learning from some of the best minds in the field about how I can best use my skills as a designer to create products that are more efficient and responsible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>What is your biggest weakness?</h4>
            <p>While I wouldn’t call it a weakness, I am still not as strong of a developer as I would like to be. At my current role, I work with a team of designers who are also fantastic developers. It is my aspiration to one day be as confident behind the terminal as I am building advanced design systems in Figma. 
                <p>While not a requirement of a great designer, I do believe that having a strong grasp on basic development - especially git and front-end frameworks - makes for a much smoother collaboration between teams.</p>
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h4>What is your process like?</h4>
               <p>I always start with defining the problem. The biggest lesson that I have learned time and again as a designer is that stating the problem correctly is half the battle. If it takes an extra round of user research to do this, it is worth every minute of time. At previous roles, I was always the team member who asked everyone to take a breath and question whether or not we were solving the right problem before we dove into months of unnecessary development. Was this annoying? Probably, but it also pushed my team to find more appropriate, and often more efficient, solutions. </p>
                <p>Once we have established a strong problem statement, I love getting my hands dirty with paper prototypes. There is nothing better than quickly iterating on ideas with only a pencil and a sheet of paper. I have found that the faster we move to prototypes and getting our ideas into the hands of users, the sooner we will begin having those a-ha breakthroughs that make every designer’s day.</p>
            <p>Once our prototypes are digitized and approved, I move into building the first atom-level designs of what will eventually make up our product’s full, responsive design system. Working in this way allows me to better communicate with developers about the properties of each component, where and how it will be used, and how we can most efficiently build out the component library on their end.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h4>Where do you want to go next?</h4>
            <p>While my work has mostly focused on websites in the past, I would like to move toward building web-based software applications. I am especially interested in working with companies that are putting social good and environmental responsibility at the forefront of what they do. I believe that in the not-too-distant-future, sustainable and energy-efficient websites will be the currency of truly conscious companies.</p>
            <p>Aside from this, I have recently begun shifting my work towards more post-launch UX work like CRO. At MailerLite, I am currently establishing our team of UX Optimizers who run A/B tests, use UX research to refine how we talk about our offerings to use the words of our users, and talk with support as often as they can to find out what our customers need and how we can best deliver it to them with better design. To put it short - I believe in focusing on customer needs to make evidence-based decisions.</p>
