        <h1>A growth-focused<br> UX designer</h1>
                <p>I’ve been designing SaaS websites and products at scale for 6 years, with a focus on post-launch optimization. In short, I make design decisions grounded in observing what users actually say & do to encourage truly sustainable growth.</p>

                <h2>Refreshing a product and everything that goes with it at MailerLite</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="summary">
                <p>Most UX case studies focus on one isolated feature. Yet growth comes not from perfection in one area but from a coherence across every facet of your product. For more than two years, I worked with dev, product, and marketing teams to design and launch new features, strategize marketing campaigns, and unify our brand voice through the first ever design system and brand guidelines created at MailerLite.<br><br> Here is a sampling of a few of the many projects that I worked on. </p>
                <div class="role-and-produced">
                    <h5 class="blue">Role: UX design and CRO</h5>
                    <h5 class="blue">produced at: in-house design team</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-cover.png" alt="">

        <p>I joined MailerLite to finalize a complete overhaul of the product. One of the key features that originally set ML apart from it's competitors was its Drag-&-Drop editor, the first in the email marketing industry.<br><br> Research told us that many users were confused by the layout of the components within the builder, as well as where to edit them. We drastically redesigned the editor UI to solve these issues, and added a simplified AI Subject Line generator that became one of our fastest-adopted features.</p>
        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-ai-writer.png" alt="">
        <p>Following the release of our updated product, we moved on to our 4-year-old web experience. The website update was a complete overhaul of how we marketed MailerLite.<br><br>We decided to rebuild the experience on the latest version of Statamic, a laravel-based CMS, allowing us to create a fresh codebase and rethink every interaction.</p>
        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-old-website-and-new.png" alt="">
        <p>Using Statamic gave use the flexibility to create custom components that our team could use to quickly build their own pages with a visual builder. Although still at the start of my development journey, I was able to design, iterate on, and develop one of our key new Community features, the Wall of Love.<br><br>The final product is easy to update and manage for our community team members, and maintained our clean, simple-solution-first design ethos. To this date, the page is regularly updated by members of other teams without issue.</p>
        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-wall-of-love.png" alt="">
        <p>Post-launch, we moved on to the next step in our growth-focused design updates. Alongside my PM, I founded the first CRO team at MailerLite. Together we created a consistent process for conducting website-visitor research and synthesizing it into experiments.<br><br>Within the first year, we found that our tiny CRO team had produced outsize gains when it came to both new signups and plan upgrades.</p>
        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-experimentation.png" alt="">
        <p>The final step in our redesign of MailerLite was to create guidelines that anyone could follow. In 2020, the ML team rapidly grew from a twenty person team to more than a hundred. Through the first ten years of business, the mindset around design was summed up in this stakeholder quote, "Good designers don't need brand guidelines."<br><br>When I joined the team in early 2021, it was clear that this mindset - coupled with rapid growth - had created multiple, fast-growing issues around design consistency. After interviewing multiple team members, it was discovered that different PM's even gave different responses about what the brand was, what it looked like, and who it was for. <br><br>There was no source of truth.</p>
        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-brand-guide.png" alt="">
        <p>To solve this problem, I orchestrated large-scale meetings between marketing, design, and product to discuss, argue, and distill just who MailerLite was and why. <br><br>These conversations were used to create the first set of brand guidelines created for MailerLite. The brand book that was designed based on these guidelines is now used company-wide and is sent to all affiliates and collaborators.<br><br> While this may seem more a task for a brand designer, the same UX principles that we used to guide the direction of the product were used here; interviews with team members allowed us to create guidelines and design tools that could benefit them. Brand guidelines, and the planning around them, are as much a part of a growth strategy as any experimentation framework or analytics tool.<br><br> Some of the most important tasks of a growth designer are those that fall into the category of improving processes and streamlining design frameworks to the point that they disappear and become second-nature for the entire team.</p>
        <img src="/images/ux-case-study-hide.png" alt="">
        <p>My time at MailerLite taught me the value of being able to work cross-team to create a unified whole. After our product and website redesign launched, we saw an immediate and consistent uptick in growth with the new MailerLite quickly outpacing the legacy version.<br><br> Although a great product comes first, growth comes from using UX insights to not only build user-focused, simple features, but to lead everything from your copywriting to your website design. As a growth-focused UX designer, I believe it is my duty to fill many shoes. Marketing strategy one day, experimentation frameworks the next, with a bit of design systems and dev thrown in for good measure.<br><br> Brilliant products deserve brilliant marketing and equally brilliant design. This is only achieved through holistic thinking and a willingness to listen to your users.<br><br> I believe great design is ethical. Why? Because design is the practice of deliberately focusing on, and responding to, your users' needs. Those needs change. You change, too. Now let's design a growth plan that doesn't feel deceitful and make the internet just a little bit better through honesty and empathy.<br><br><a href="mailto:codydavidlampman@gmail.com">Email me about a project.</a> </p>

        <ul id="accordion">
            <li>
                <label for="first"><h4>What makes you different?</h4></label>
                <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="first" checked>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>My non-traditional path to UX is what sets my approach apart. I worked in hospitality, roasted coffee for a designer-founded coffee shop, shot editorial photography, worked for a non-profit on the Navajo reservation, and even skated professionally. It was through skating that I became involved working with various brands to help build their reputations through the design and copywriting on their websites. This naturally led to an (obsessive) interest in user experience design. Around the time that I began to study UX, I also became a practicing student of Zen Buddhism.</p> <p>Suprisingly, many of the key elements of UX design - empathy, critical thinking, and challenging biases - are inherent in Zen buddhist practice. Suffice to say, UX is something that has become a part of my life that is much bigger than just pixels on a display. It influences almost every aspect of my day-to-day life.  
                        <p>At first, this winding path to design resulted in a lot of imposter syndrome, but I have come to see the value that having a diverse set of skills brings. Most recently I have developed a passion for sustainable web design, and have been learning from some of the best minds in the field about how I can best use my skills as a designer to create products that are more efficient and responsible.</p>        
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="second"><h4>What is your biggest weakness?</h4></label>
                <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="second">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>While I wouldn’t call it a weakness, I am still not as strong of a developer as I would like to be. At my current role, I work with a team of designers who are also fantastic developers. It is my aspiration to one day be as confident behind the terminal as I am building advanced design systems in Figma. 
                        <p>While not a requirement of a great designer, I do believe that having a strong grasp on basic development - especially git and front-end frameworks - makes for a much smoother collaboration between teams.</p>
                    </p></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="third"><h4>What is your process like?</h4></label>
                <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="third">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>I always start with defining the problem. The biggest lesson that I have learned time and again as a designer is that stating the problem correctly is half the battle. If it takes an extra round of user research to do this, it is worth every minute of time. At previous roles, I was always the team member who asked everyone to take a breath and question whether or not we were solving the right problem before we dove into months of unnecessary development. Was this annoying? Probably, but it also pushed my team to find more appropriate, and often more efficient, solutions. </p>
                    <p>Once we have established a strong problem statement, I love getting my hands dirty with paper prototypes. There is nothing better than quickly iterating on ideas with only a pencil and a sheet of paper. I have found that the faster we move to prototypes and getting our ideas into the hands of users, the sooner we will begin having those a-ha breakthroughs that make every designer’s day.</p>
                <p>Once our prototypes are digitized and approved, I move into building the first atom-level designs of what will eventually make up our product’s full, responsive design system. Working in this way allows me to better communicate with developers about the properties of each component, where and how it will be used, and how we can most efficiently build out the component library on their end.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <label for="fourth"><h4>Where do you want to go next?</h4></label>
                <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="fourth">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>While my work has mostly focused on websites in the past, I would like to move toward building web-based software applications. I am especially interested in working with companies that are putting social good and environmental responsibility at the forefront of what they do. I believe that in the not-too-distant-future, sustainable and energy-efficient websites will be the currency of truly conscious companies.</p>
            <p>Aside from this, I have recently begun shifting my work towards more post-launch UX work like CRO. At MailerLite, I am currently establishing our team of UX Optimizers who run A/B tests, use UX research to refine how we talk about our offerings to use the words of our users, and talk with support as often as they can to find out what our customers need and how we can best deliver it to them with better design. To put it short - I believe in focusing on customer needs to make evidence-based decisions.</p>
